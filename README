General
-------

Hydra is a process management system for starting parallel jobs,
especially MPICH2 jobs. Hydra is designed to natively work with
multiple daemons such as ssh, pbs, slurm and sge. However, in the
current release, only ssh is supported.

How to use Hydra
----------------

To use hydra, mpich2 needs to be configured with the configure option
--with-pm=hydra.

Once MPICH2 has been built with Hydra, the Hydra commands are in
mpich2/bin, or the bin subdirectory of the install directory if you
have done an install.  You should put this (bin) directory in your
PATH in your .cshrc or .bashrc, so that it will be picked up by the
mpd's that are started remotely:

Put in .cshrc:  setenv PATH /home/you/mpich2/bin:$PATH

Put in .bashrc: export PATH=/home/you/mpich2/bin:$PATH

To compile your application use mpicc:

 $ mpicc app.c -o app

Create a file with the names of the machines that you want to run your
job on. This file may or may not include the local machine.

 $ cat hosts

   donner.mcs.anl.gov
   foo.mcs.anl.gov
   shakey.mcs.anl.gov
   terra.mcs.anl.gov

To run your application on these nodes, use mpiexec:

 $ mpiexec -n 4 -f hosts ./app
